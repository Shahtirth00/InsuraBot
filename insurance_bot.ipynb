    "InsuraBot employs the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture** , integrating **OpenAI's LLM**, (Large Language Model) based on the 3.5 version. It utilizes **FAISS for vector database management** and **OpenAI embeddings** for enhanced understanding. With LLM employing a **'similarity' retrieval mechanism**, fine-tuning is facilitated through PDF and CSV files. Additionally, **prompt engineering is optimized through template usage.** with **LangChain's chain** function orchestrating seamless integration and communication among the components..\""
